# Snake-Game

Hey, so here's the classic snake game that i have built using the Turtle module in Python....Remember the good old memories of playing this game? 
Relish it by making this and enhance your coding skills.
I have added an extra functionality too that is an obstacle(turtle) appears randomly at different positions, and if the snake touches it the score decreases by one, which otherwise increases by one if the snake eats the food.
  
I broke down the game into sub-problems which were :

1. Create a snake body.
2. Move the snake.
3. Control the snake.
4. Detect collision with food.
5. Create a scoreboard
6. Detect collision with wall.

I hope you have fun building this game and playing it!
